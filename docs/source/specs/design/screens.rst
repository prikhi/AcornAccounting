.. _Screen Designs:

Screen Descriptions
====================

AcornAccounting is web-based and each distinct web page is considered a screen.
Each screen is generated by the `Django`_ back-end framework and will use the
`Twitter Bootstrap`_ front-end framework.

The following :term:`wireframes <wireframe>` may not be rendered/styled with the
front-end elements and are meant to convey the layout of the application, not
it's final appearance or style.

The Wireframes are built using `Pencil`_ and the Pencil Document is
:download:`available for download <_files/wireframe.ep>`.

Global Design
--------------

The following design features will be implemented consistently throughout the
application:

* All Date fields will require the input to be in some combination of
  ``MM/DD/YYYY`` or ``M/D/YY`` format, such as ``01/2/13`` or ``3/20/12``.
  Clicking a Date field will pop-up a calendar, allowing the User to select a
  date, instead of having to enter one.

* Table rows will change their font/background colors to a unique set when
  moused over.

* Negative balances and amounts will be surrounded by parenthesis,
  ``($22.00)``, instead of having minus signs, ``-$22.00``.

.. _General Layout Design:

General Layout
---------------

The general layout of the website will follow the basic Header-Content-Footer
model:

* Header - Company Logo/Title, Navigation
* Content - Each screens unique content
* Footer - Copyright, Additional Links(feedback, bug report, documentation)

:ref:`Account Detail Page <Account Detail Page Design>` and :ref:`Event Detail
Page <Event Detail Page Design>`.

Sub-Menu <Admin Submenu Design>`, specific pages will be accessible by clicking
on the respective items in the Sub-Menu.

If the User is logged in, a table will be displayed, showing links to the
Accounts, Headers and Events sub-pages.

Otherwise, a login form containing fields for a Username and Password will be
displayed.

**Final Conditions**

If the User is not logged in, submitting the form will validate the User's
Login Credentials, redirecting to the main Admin Page if valid.

.. _Chart of Accounts Page Design:

Chart of Accounts Page
-----------------------

The Chart of Accounts Page displays all Headers and Accounts of the Company,
and their respective Balances.

*Case 1* describes accessing the global Chart of Accounts. *Case 2* describes
accessing the Chart of Accounts recursively, by clicking on a Header row in
the Chart of Accounts.

**Entry Conditions**

*Case 1*

This screen is accessible through the ``Chart of Accounts`` link in the
:ref:`Accounts Sub-Menu <Accounts Submenu Design>`.

It is currently the :ref:`Home Page <Home Page Design>` and therefore clicking
the Company Name/Logo to the left of the :ref:`Navigation <Site Navigation
Design>` will redirect the user to this screen.

*Case 2*

The screen is also recursively accessible, clicking on a Header row in this
screen will send the User to a Chart of Accounts Page for that specific Header.

**Initial Conditions**

*Case 1*

The page will display a series of tabs above a single table. The Tabs will be
named by the different Account Types(Assets, Liability, Equity, etc.) and the
currently selected tab will be differentiated by color. By default the table
will contain all Headers and Accounts that are Assets and the Asset Tab will be
selected.

The Table will have headings for Account Numbers, Names, Descriptions and
Current Balances. The Headers' font and background colors will be different
from Accounts'. Child Headers and Accounts will have their names indented one
level higher than their Parent Header, like in the following example::

    I am the Highest Header
        I am its child Account
        I am a sub-Header
            I am the sub-Header's child Account

Mousing over a row should highlight that row in a unique color, and removing
the mouse from a row should revert the effect.

*Case 2*

If the screen is accessed recursively by a Header row hyperlink, the screen
will emulate *Case 1* except the tabs will be replaced with breadcrumb links up
the Header's ancestor tree. Instead of showing all Headers and Accounts, only
the children of the selected Header will be displayed.

**Intermediate Conditions**

*Case 1*

Clicking an Account Type Tab will replace the table, Headers, and Accounts
currently displayed with a table containing all Headers and Accounts of the
newly selected Account Type.

**Final Conditions**

Each row of the table will be a hyperlink. Header rows will link back to the
Chart of Accounts Page, using the selected Header for *Case 2*. Account rows
will link to the Account's :ref:`Account Detail Page <Account Detail Page
Design>`.

There will be 2 hyperlinks for Accountants/Administrators, ``Edit`` for

The table will be populated with Transactions within the date range. The table
will have headings for the Entry Number, Date, Memo, Transaction Detail,
Debit/Credit, Event and Account Balance. The Account Balance will only be shown
if the date range is within the current Fiscal Year.

The table will contain a footer that displays the total amounts of Debits and
Credits and the Net Change(Credits - Debits) for the date range. If the date
range is within the current Fiscal Year, a ``Start Balance`` and ``End
Balance`` will also be shown.

**Final Conditions**

The ``Edit`` Hyperlink will direct the User to the Account's :ref:`Edit
Page <Account Admin Design>`. The ``Reconcile`` Hyperlink will direct the User
to the Account's :ref:`Reconcile Page <Reconcile Account Page Design>`.

Clicking on a row in the table will direct the user to the :ref:`Entry Detail
Page <Journal Entry Detail Pages Design>` for the specific Transaction. If an

*Case 2*

Submitting a valid ``Statement Balance`` and ``Statement Date`` on the Account
Reconcile *Case 1* screen will direct the User to the *Case 2* screen.

**Initial Conditions**

*Case 1*

The screen will contain a Heading and a form to retrieve Transactions.

The heading will be ``Reconcile`` followed by the Account's Name.

The form will have inputs for the Statement Date and Statement Balance. If the
Account has previously been reconciled, the previous Statement Date and
Statement Balance will also be shown(labeled as the ``Last Reconciled Date``
and ``Reconciled Balance``).
